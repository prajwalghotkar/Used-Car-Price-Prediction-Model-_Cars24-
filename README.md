# ðŸš— Used Car Price Prediction Model â€“ Cars24 Business Case
This project is built as part of a real-world business case for **Cars24**, a leading platform for buying and selling used cars in India.  The objective is to **automate the pricing mechanism** using a machine learning model that estimates the price of a used car based on its specifications and condition, replacing manual and rule-based processes.

Description:
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based solution to automate the estimation of used car prices for Cars24, one of India's leading online platforms for buying and selling pre-owned vehicles.

Traditionally, used car prices are calculated using:

Historical price records for similar models

Rule-based depreciation methods

Manual condition assessments

These methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack personalization. To improve this, I developed a predictive ML model that automatically estimates the price of a used car based on relevant attributes such as make, model, age, fuel type, transmission, and more.

This solution empowers pricing analysts, business teams, and non-technical users by delivering fast, consistent, and data-driven price estimatesâ€”enhancing decision-making and increasing customer trust.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is built as part of a real-world business case for **Cars24**, a leading platform for buying and selling used cars in India.

The objective is to **automate the pricing mechanism** using a machine learning model that estimates the price of a used car based on its specifications and condition, replacing manual and rule-based processes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Cars24 currently estimates prices using:
- Past selling prices of the same make and model
- Rule-based depreciation logic
- Manual condition checks

These approaches are:
- Time-consuming
- Inconsistent
- Not scalable

ðŸ‘‰ **Goal:** Build a predictive model to estimate used car prices **automatically** and **accurately.**

---

## ðŸ§  Solution
Using supervised learning, we trained a regression model on historical car listings to predict prices based on relevant features such as:
- Make & Model
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage
- Transmission & Fuel Type
- Owner history
- Engine size, torque, etc.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn (Regression models)**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
